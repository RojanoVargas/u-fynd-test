 "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough." - Elon Musk

This file is part of the task 1 of the u:fynd recruiting process.


Task 2
1. history.php and launches.php are located in the "task 2 & task 3" folder.
2. As requested, history is a simple template page: <?php /* Template Name: history */ ?>
Launches has more content (as requested for task 3)
3. To be displayed in any WordPress site, the CMSâ€™s user needs to:
    3.1. Add the files history.php and launches.php in the route: wp-content/themes/active-theme (where active-theme is the name of the theme)
    3.2. In WordPress go to Pages -> Add New -> Page Attributes (right bar) -> Template: history/launches -> Publish


Task 3
functions.php:
1. The CMS's user needs to copy all content from our the functions.php to the bottom of the functions.php of their WordPress (the file is on the same route as the ones from 3.1 on task 2) - this code creates a custom post type and scrapes the API

I have been testing my solutions on a local WordPress. Anything can be shown on the interview. I'll keep the credentials here in case of needing it when showing it to you: user: eloy / pass: ufynd_test_pass

Fun fact: when I tried to retrieve data from the API of V4 (instead of V3), this video url was printed on the screen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg and it didn't let me access any of the API content.

Task 4
1. I created a wireframe to have a clear overview of the skeletal outline of the landing that can be visited here: https://wireframe.cc/IBNojS
2. The branding was inspired (and adapted) from one of the pages in the original website: https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/ 
3. In the folder "Task 4" you will find the index.html, linked with a stylesheet (style.css) and "images". Drag the index.html into your browser to navigate the page. I would recommend using Google Chrome for the best experience.
